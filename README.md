# Nissan-350Z-3D-model
Nissan 350Z 3D model created in AutoCAD

The project catches my passion for cars, in a university project where I had to model any object possible in AutoCAD, I've decided to create a complete 3D model of a Nissan 350Z. The model was created at a 1:100 scale to be as precise as possible and includes I would say 75% of a real car. The model was developed from a 2D design that was transposed in 3D. Regarding the components of the car I included the body, separate door panels, mirrors, trunk and Bonet. I've also added wheels and tyres created individually. A complete braking system, mounting point for the wheels with the bolts. Underneath the car, can be found the suspension, the car frame and also a complete exhaust system. Regarding the exterior I've added the lights and auxiliary a wing. And regarding the interior I've included seats, shifter, wheel, pedals and hand-brake. For more information about the project check the documentation which includes all the details of the project from motivtion to the AutoCAD implementation.
